= About Me

Hi, I'm a graduate student preparing for the National Postgraduate Entrance Examination (NPEE) in Computer Science.#footnote[The NPEE is one of the most competitive academic exams in China, with millions of candidates each year.] This website serves as my digital notebook and personal space for learning and reflection.

== Background

I'm passionate about computer science, mathematics, and the intersection of technology with everyday life. My academic interests include:

- *Algorithms & Data Structures* — The building blocks of efficient software
- *Operating Systems* — Understanding how computers actually work
- *Machine Learning* — Exploring the frontier of AI

== Why This Website?

I believe in learning in public. Writing helps me clarify my thoughts, and sharing those thoughts helps others who might be on a similar journey.#footnote[The "Learn in Public" philosophy was popularized by Shawn Wang and emphasizes the value of documenting one's learning process.]

This site is built with #link("https://typst.app/")[Typst], a modern typesetting system that makes academic writing a joy. The design is inspired by Edward Tufte's principles of information design.

Feel free to reach out if you'd like to discuss ideas, collaborate on projects, or just say hi.
