== How I Organize Notes

I follow a modified Zettelkasten method,#footnote[Zettelkasten, German for "slip box," is a note-taking system that emphasizes atomic notes and connections between ideas.] focusing on:

1. *Atomic notes* — Each note covers one concept
2. *Linking* — Connecting related ideas across domains
3. *Progressive summarization* — Highlighting key points for quick review
