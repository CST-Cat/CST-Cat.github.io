= Projects

A showcase of personal projects, experiments, and side quests. Some are polished, others are works in progress.#footnote[I believe in shipping early and iterating. Not everything here is perfect, but everything taught me something.]

== Featured

=== This Website

A static site built with Typst and Tufted, featuring custom typography and a clean design inspired by Edward Tufte's work.

- *Stack*: Typst, Python, HTML/CSS
- *Source*: #link("https://github.com/")[GitHub Repository]

=== NPEE Study Toolkit

A collection of scripts and tools to help with exam preparation, including:

- Flashcard generator from notes
- Progress tracking dashboard
- Pomodoro timer with statistics

== Experiments

=== Algorithm Visualizer

An interactive tool for visualizing sorting and searching algorithms. Built to deepen understanding of algorithm behavior.#footnote[Visualization is a powerful learning tool. Seeing an algorithm in action makes it much easier to understand than reading pseudocode alone.]

=== Markdown to Typst Converter

A Python script that converts Markdown files to Typst format, preserving formatting and handling edge cases.

== Ideas Backlog

Things I want to build when I have time:

- Personal knowledge graph
- Spaced repetition system for code
- Minimalist habit tracker
