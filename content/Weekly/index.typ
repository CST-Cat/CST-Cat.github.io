A log of my weekly progress, reflections, and goals. Inspired by the practice of weekly reviews in GTD (Getting Things Done).#footnote[David Allen's GTD methodology emphasizes regular reviews as essential for maintaining clarity and focus.]

== Weekly Review Template

Each week I ask myself:

1. *What went well?* — Celebrate small wins
2. *What could be improved?* — Honest assessment without judgment
3. *What did I learn?* — Knowledge and skills gained
4. *What's the focus for next week?* — Clear priorities
